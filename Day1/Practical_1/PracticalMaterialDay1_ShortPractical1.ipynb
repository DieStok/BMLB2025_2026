    "Let's load some sample data and visualise it. We use matplotlib, numpy, and pandas to do this. Pandas is used to make so-called DataFrames, which are tables that usually have observations in the rows and features or properties in the columns. Unlike matrices, they can contain many data types (i.e. one column is a descriptive string, the other is numeric, etc.). Numpy is a library for working with numbers in Python. It comes with a data type called arrays, which can also have rows and columns. Numpy will be used to perform calculations for fitting ML models when necessary. Numpy and Pandas both have great documentation ([Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)), so be sure to search online when you need to use functions from these packages during the exercises and it isn't working out."

    "What you can see above is that for non-normalised data (top row), gradient descent is having a hard time quickly finding a good estimate, and is jumping back and forth along the path to a good theta1. The new value for $\\theta_1$ found by a gradient descent step is dependent on x, which is on a scale from 0-100, while $\\theta_0$ is just dependent on the errors, which are on a much smaller scale. Because of this, $\\theta_0$ almost doesn't change whereas $\\theta_1$ quickly jumps all over the place if you don't normalise. Therefore, we are also forced to use a very low alpha (0.0005), and even then it's not perfect, as you still see jumps back and forth. <br> <br>\n",
