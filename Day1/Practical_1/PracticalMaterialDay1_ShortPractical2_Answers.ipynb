    "## Making a function for data normalisation\n",
    "Good. You've seen in **Exercise 1** and in the lectures that the features should be normalised to make gradient descent work well. High time to write a function to normalise these features. Call it `createNormalisedFeatures`. The function should have two arguments: `featureArray` that accepts a 2D numpy array where columns are features, and `mode` that accepts two inputs, 'SD' and 'range'. For 'SD', the normalisation should return:\n",
    "* the mean of each feature.\n",
    "* the standard deviation of each feature.\n",
    "* the normalised feature itself, using the formula: <br> $$\\frac{(feature\\ values - feature\\ mean)}{feature\\ standard\\  deviation}$$ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For 'range' as input the normalisation should return:\n",
    "* the mean of each feature.\n",
    "* the range of each feature (max - min).\n",
    "* the normalised feature itself, using the formula:\n",
    "$$\\frac{(feature\\ values - feature\\ mean)}{(feature\\ max - feature\\ min)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After you are done, test your function on a Numpy array with a linear and a quadratic feature (i.e. made with `power = 2` in `makePolynomialFeatures`) using `mode = 'range'`. Code to plot the features in this space has been provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why do we need the means and std. dev./range saved?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need these saved so if we want to predict for an unseen data point, we can transform its features in the same way we do with our training data: by subtracting the means of the training data and dividing by the std.dev./range as we do in our normalisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why these different normalisations? <br>\n",
    "The SD normalisation brings features to *approximately* the \\[-1,1\\] range, however outliers still go slightly above or below this: we normalise based on the standard deviation or average difference of the data from the mean, so points that are far from this mean will have larger values. In other words: this assumes a normal distribution of data, and shrinks that distribution to have mean 0 and *most* of its observations in the \\[-1,1\\] range. <br>\n",
    "The range normalisation brings everything to a \\[-1,1\\] range outright, no exceptions. Do note that if you have huge outliers, most data will be compressed to a tiny range, with the outliers being close to 1 or -1. Which is better? Truth be told, I don't know, and it probably depends. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b> Hints </b> \n",
    "* To return multiple values in one function, simply put them in a list: `return [thing1,thing2,ChickenLittle]`. In this case, order the return values like so: `[normalisedFeatures, featureMeans, featureSD/featureRanges]` <br>\n",
    "* `np.mean()`, and `np.std()` are your friends here. Be sure to set the right axis!\n",

    "## Final words\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Aaarghh\". But also: well done! Time for one more lecture, in which we'll dive into using linear algebra to make our calculations (and hopefully also our function definitions) easier, and/or further explore the bias-variance trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: linear regression actually has an algebraically defined minimum of the cost function, which can also be approached via something called the Normal Equation (given tractable data size). Hence, linear regression libraries will probably make use of this method if feasible, and many other speed ups and other features. Still, doing it yourself is an achievement!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I'd like you to remember here:\n",
    "* Extending linear regression to multinomial (and polynomial, i.e. with exponents) regression is relatively straightforward once you have the basic routine down.\n",
    "* How to normalise data. Especially the mean-centering and scaling to unit variance (data-mean(data))/std(data) is used very often. \n",
    "* Why normalising data is important: that otherwise you get gradients operating at different scales, messing up your gradient steps, and costs which are much higher for the polynomial variables than for the others. To avoid this, we normalise. You'll be using normalisation prodigiously throughout the rest of the course. Note that also, features that are on different scales would otherwise weigh differently in cost calculations etc. Squares of a feature that can have up to 10.000 as a value can become much higher than one that goes up only until 100.\n",
    "* That running polynomial regression on a linear relationship is a bit bonkers (but illustrative, nonetheless)\n",
