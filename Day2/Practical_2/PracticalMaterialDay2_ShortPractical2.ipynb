    "## Regularisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularisation is a method of automatically constraining how much your model can (over)fit on the training data. We add some factor (regularisation weight $\\lambda$) times the sum of squares of the parameter (excluding the intercept ($\\theta_0$) to the cost function. In this way, the model cannot pick extremely large values for the parameters, i.e. when you have 100 features, the model is forced to only have high $\\theta$ parameters for those features that matter a lot for correct classification, while having extremely low or even 0 values for features that don't. Hence, regularisation also automatically selects features that are of importance to your problem: _feature selection_! (Strictly speaking, this holds only for when you penalise the absolute of the sum of the parameters, not when you penalise the square). Note that once you have trained the model and want to know the cost on the validation/test set, you should not use regularised cost: you care about your performance in the end (which you hope is better because you constrain the parameters during fitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "* To get started, change your costFuncLogReg to have an extra argument `lambda_ = 0` ( _ because lambda is a keword for anonymous functions), that, if set to a value higher than 0, causes regularisation to be performed.\n",
    "* Make sure to exclude the bias/intercept term ($\\theta_0$) from this. By convention this is not regularised.\n",
    "* While you are at it, also reorder the arguments to `thetas, x, y, lambda_=0` so it is easier to use another optimizer if we want to!\n",

    "If all goes well, you will see that the cost on the test set is lowest when using $\\lambda > 0$. Isn't that grand!? Not too strange when we all but forced overfitting by adding lots of uninformative features.  Spectacularly unconvincing example notwithstanding: in general, for unregularised classification, you run the risk of tuning the parameters _too specifically_ to the values in the training set, which increases the cost on the unseen test set. Regularisation guards against this by penalising too large parameters."
